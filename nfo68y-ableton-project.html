I accidentally recorded myself singing and processed my vocals not knowing i did it in 32 bit. The rest of my project is in 24 bit. Every time I bounce it, there feels to be something slightly off about the final sound. What can I do to ensure the most purest sound that is indistinguishable from the project to the audio file. FYI my sample rate is 44.1, bit depth is 24. I can give any more information if needed.  I started this is r/ableton but moved here for additional insight. amp#x200B; When I create a new project and set a decent mix using my monitors/headphones it usually sounds like crap when I play it for my band mates over the PA at rehearsal. Im using a stereo balanced cable out of my Presonus Audiobox, through a Mackie Mixer and out to non powered speakers. There are 2 speakers on each side and the second speaker is daisy chained from the first. The PA isn't great so I understand Reverse engineering tracks is a great way to practice your production game, in this video I walk through the elements (drums, chords, bass) of Please Me and how they all come together to create the hit record. https://youtu.be/s6IcX9asuFs. So apparently re-saving an Ableton project doesn't purge unused samples anymore (new beta). Do we have to go through the project samples and delete them all individually now? 0.0 Anybody have insight Long story short, I had all my completed projects from the past three years in a folder on my new backup- backup harddrive. I reformatted my harddrive and it erased the folder.

So I started to learn Ableton live a few months ago and all the tutorials mentioned that I should export my midi to wav or flac for mixing and mastering. So I had a project for composing then one for mixing and one for mastering. It was a mess to export everything out then drop it back and rename, regroup everything again. Yesterday I've tried to use only one project to do everything and it worked out well, only the CPU usage was higher a bit like 50-60%. So my question is: why should Neuro Basses are some of the most intricate, interesting sounds in dance music. Creating them may be simple in theory, but proper execution for a full, great sounding Neuro Bass is harder than it seems.

I've got a couple tracks I finished last year that I never used, by far the two favourites of every track I've made. For some reason I cannot find them amongst the other projects that I made around the same time, I've checked in every folder they could be in and indexed the entire computer by .als and by projects modified in the period I released them on Soundcloud but I can't find either. I've even gone through every single project with an undefined name, reloaded the samples and listened Hi guys. I've been a long time user of Serum, however I've never tried to transfer presets and projects from Ableton to a new computer. I am doing this today, and I notice everything copies to the new machine flawlessly except for the presets in Serum. They're set at "Int" which is the default preset that Serum opens up to. I even tried to extract the actual preset files themselves from my original machine, and transferring them over and it STILL did not work. All of the other user presets Yesterday I clicked through an installer too fast and ended up with Avast on my computer. I was busy so I didn't think much of it, and uninstalled it at the end of the day. The problem is at some point yesterday I restarted my computer and Avast automatically deleted a bunch of files on my computer, and since I already uninstalled it I can't go into their "Virus Chest" to get them back. I really should've had it all backed up but if anyone has any ideas on getting 
I really enjoyed watching Mr. Bill's tutorials (https://live.mrbillstunes.com/). It's great to see someone with a decade or more of experience produce catchy tunes using all sorts of tricks of the trade, driving you through the thought process and the choices they had to make. His tutorials also include the final project files, for easy reference. Where can I find more resources like that? Is anybody else out there putting out that kind of quality walkthroughs that cover both Ableton and genera. Hey guys, I just would export some of my projects for others producers, so they could open this project in Ableton and work on that. But, I have some questions: 1. What if producer does not have some of my plugins which I used in project? How make that this producer open this project properly? 2. I have 64 bit Ableton, but in some of my projects I use 32but plugins via jBridge. Is this problem for producers who do not have jBridge? Would this project crash if they do not have jBridge? Thanks.
